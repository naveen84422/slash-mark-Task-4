# Blood Donation Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project predicts future blood donations using **Machine Learning** techniques. By analyzing donor patterns, the model helps healthcare organizations maintain an adequate blood supply and reduce shortages.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing donor trends.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Using algorithms like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance.
- **Prediction & Insights:** Identifying key factors influencing blood donation frequency.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blood-donation-forecast.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd blood-donation-forecast
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset includes donor information like **age, last donation date, frequency of donations, and blood type**.
- Ensure the dataset is in CSV format with appropriate preprocessing before training.

## Usage
1. **Train the Model**: Run the training script to train the model.
2. **Evaluate Model**: Analyze accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict future donations.

To train the model, run:
```sh
python train.py
```

## Results
- The model effectively predicts donors likely to donate in the future.
- Feature importance analysis highlights critical factors influencing blood donation.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Deep Learning models** for improved accuracy.
- Deploy as a **web app** for real-time blood donation forecasting.
- Integrate **real-time donor tracking** for better predictions.
